HouseCupBot
===========

Reddit bot that keeps a running score for Hogwarts houses.

- When the bot detects a string like "50 points for Gryffindor" it will add 50 points to Gryffindor's running total.
    - Limits are set to (max: 500 points/ min: 1 point) to prevent ridiculous scores and removing points for a house. 
    - Awarding of points is rate-limited per redditor. A redditor is only allowed to add points to a house every 30 minutes.
- *A winner is decided quarterly and all points are reset to 0. Winners will be tracked via SQL database.
- Commands available:
    - *"HouseCupBot !winners": Will reply via PM with the past winners of the House Cup.

    *= In Development
